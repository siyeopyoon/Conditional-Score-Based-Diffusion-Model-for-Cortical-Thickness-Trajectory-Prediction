# Conditional-Score-Based-Diffusion-Model-for-Cortical-Thickness-Trajectory-Prediction


This repository contains the source code associated with our paper titled "Conditional-Score-Based-Diffusion-Model-for-Cortical-Thickness-Trajectory-Prediction" which has been accepted at MICCAI 2024.

## Requirements

Ensure all the necessary packages listed.

numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-image click requests psutil tqdm imageio imageio-ffmpeg pyspng pillow 

## Dataset 

We evaluated our conditional score-based diffusion model using the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) challenge cohort (https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/).

Example of data format is located under "https://github.com/siyeopyoon/Conditional-Score-Based-Diffusion-Model-for-Cortical-Thickness-Trajectory-Prediction/tree/main/Example%20Data%20Foramt"


## Running the Training/Experiments

To conduct experiments, please build adn run docker image using the command below. Note that you should adjust the paths and hyperparameters according to your specific requirements:

1. move to the location of source code (where dockerfile is located).
2. Build docker image

```bash
sudo docker build -f ./dockerfile_train_residual -t model_train_residual ./
```

3. Run docker image
```bash
sudo docker run --shm-size=8G --rm --gpus all -v /home/example/:/external/ model_train_residual
```
Note; here "/home/example/" is where source code and dockerfile are located in your GPU server.


4. To perform experimentsn, please build adn run docker image using the command below. 
```bash
sudo docker build -f ./dockerfile_generate_residual -t generate_residual ./
```
```bash
sudo docker run --shm-size=8G --rm --gpus all -v /home/example/:/external/ generate_residual
```
